# Deep learning with Google Colab
  In this repository, we will use the Colab Notebook free GPU to capture objects with the YOLO algorithm. Start training your model by following the steps below.
  
  
## 1- Download Dataset 
### https://www.kaggle.com/doganozcan/license-plate-dataset-for-yolo

## 2- Create Folder Named yolov4
Right click on drive home page and press create new folder. Then create the files as below and apply what I wrote in the notebook. Create an empty folder called backup inside this folder, after the model training is finished, our weights will be saved here. And if you did everything right, run the notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XcJLsKyGi_04QF1ugwuUO9aCqJc7COLI?usp=sharing)

## 3- Testing the Model
To test the model, you can create a separate folder and put pictures and videos in it.
